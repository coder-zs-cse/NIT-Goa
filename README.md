## This repository aims to cache the flow of resources from seniors to juniors.
### Idea behind using GitHub as a platform is to give Git & GitHub exposure to tech students at the same time.

If you find any lecture notes/ important book pdfs/ question papers, etc missing, then feel free to add the resource by initiating a pull request, or you may raise an issue or follow up on an existing issue. 😄 

Do give a star ⭐ for the repo, if it was helpful to you in anyway🌟 

Sharing is Caring❤️

PS: currently the 2nd, 3rd year resources are of CSE branch
